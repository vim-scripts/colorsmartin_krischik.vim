I don't expect anybody bu me to like the colors. But I do think you will like the clean layout of the script file and the symbolic color names used when you plan to create your own color scheme.

Tested with Linux (gui, terminal, console), MS-Windows (gui, terminal) and OpenVMS (gui, terminal).

Optimized for GUI use and readable with terminal and console.
